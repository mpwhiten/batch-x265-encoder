# batch-x265-encoder
A script written in PowerShell to scan through a video library and re-encode files to x265 to save storage space.

I initially wrote the script several years ago. In its current form it's messy and is in desperate need of cleaning up, but it works. It will do for now, until I find time to clean it up and optimise.

My intention is to re-write this in python so that it can be used on other platforms (eg. my linux based NAS).
